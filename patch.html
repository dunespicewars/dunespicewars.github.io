											<h3>House Harkonnen</h3>
											<p>House Harkonnen shares its chilling reputation with its leader, Baron Vladimir Harkonnen.  They have been called despotic, merciless, scheming and devious.  And those are only their finer qualities.

											<h3>Smugglers</h3>
											<p>There’s a fine line between smugglers and full-fledged bandits, and Esmar Tuek is adept at walking that line.  Smugglers can provide anything to anyone, provided they put the price… and do not look at the specifics too closely.
